# Youtube-Scrapping using Youtube Data api 

This is a simple python project to scrape youtube data using youtube api. I'll try my level best to make it more interactive and add more features like storing 
it in mongoDB and Visualize it through streamlit on my upcoming projects.

Using YouTube API, we extract the data and then load this data into a Python Pandas DataFrame and then analyze this data.
Finally, we build simple visualization from this data using the Python Seaborn library.

I'll be using Jupyter notebook to write my python code. We extract channel details from youtube. I.e. we extract details such as youtube channel name,
total no of subscribers, total views and total number of videos posted by each channel. We gather these details for few Tech Youtubers of channel and 
then compare these channel data with each other. We shall see who has the highest subscriber and who gets the most views and the amount of videos posted 
by these channels. We will be loading all of this data into a pandas dataframe and then analyze it. We will also generate some basic visualization using 
this data so we can easily compare these multiple channels.

we shall build a logic to extract video details from a particular channel. We shall extract details such as video title, total views each video has got, 
total number of likes, dislikes and comments each video has got. We shall extract these details for all of the videos posted by a particular channel. We will 
then analyze this data by loading it into a pandas dataframe.At the end we will create some simple visualization using Seaborn python library.
